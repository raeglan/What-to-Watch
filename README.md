# What is this repo?
The simple popular movies app for the Android Udacity course.

# What to do before building the app?!
I didn't commit any API key I might use(for obvious reasons), so if you want to build it on your own you should do the following:
- Generate an API Key on https://www.themoviedb.org/
- Create an interface with the name `APIKeys`
- Inside the interface declare `String MOVIEDB_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"`
- Compile the code, install the APK and be happy.

# What I am trying to accomplish?
Well, first I will be using the Material Design principles and theme, which can backfire. Most of all I am hoping to write my first big-ish
Android app.

# What is your motivation for trying Android Development?
Learning new things is always great, being able to build my own apps from scratch is a nice bonus. And in my new workplace I need to sometimes
write Android code, so there is that.

# And finally, What to watch?
There are many great movies available, in a myriad of different platforms, Download the app, and the most popular ones out there!
